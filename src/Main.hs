Architecture:

1. Game state.
The basic idea is that there's a function updating the game state.
This function will run in its own thread at a certain speed (meaning
the sample rate of the state).
Regarding the updates, they will happen by means of passage of time
and user input. Let's call it a controlled simulation.

2. Rendering
Another function will take care of rendering the state (either directly
or to something like diagrams, which will be subsequently passed to
the actual backend). This function will run in another thread and
another rate and will simply pick whatever state is currently available.

3. Input
a) listen to events
b) poll state


Note: I'm not sure how FRP is supposed to help us here.
However, I can see how a SAC could save a lot of recomputation in
rendering (a la React) and perhaps in game stepping too.
